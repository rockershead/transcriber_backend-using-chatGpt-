# transcriber_backend-using-chatGpt-

I created a Docker application which utilizes the chatGpt api and to transcribe voice recordings to text.At the moment it can only process mp3 files.For voice recordings over 25mb, they have to be split into 5min components before using the chatGpt api to transcribe.I am doing for recordings that are less than 25mb also.
